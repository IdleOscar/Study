  BA.innerHTML = "Barcelona will reportedly receive a whopping €500 million for Camp Nou’s title rights over a 20 year deal with Spotify once all the renovations are done. According to SPORT, Barcelona are only a few formalities away from signing a global sponsorship deal with the audio streaming platform Spotify. While this includes changing the shirt sponsor, the team is also working on selling Camp Nou’s naming rights during the remodelling of the stadium. As reported before, the first team kit sponsorship deal is valued at €60 million while the part on the back at €5 million. Furthermore, once the Espai Barça work concludes, the team will look for a new contract that will be worth around €20-25 million. Meanwhile, the initial agreement signed between the club and Spotify would consist of €280 million for the next three seasons in total, and it is suggested that the team expects a majority of this amount to invest in the possible signing of Erling Haaland in the summer.";
  DA.innerHTML ="Spurs arrived at the Etihad Stadium on horrific run having lost three games in a row. Antonio Conte's side were in dreamland within four minutes however as Harry Kane sent Son Heung-min into the City half with a reverse pass. Son darted into the box and drew Ederson out of his net, before squaring the ball to Dejan Kulusevski who tapped home. City grew into the game and dominated, with the breakthrough coming in the 33rd minute through Ilkay Gundogan. Raheem Sterling fizzed a ball into the box which Hugo Lloris spurned under pressure from Kevin De Bruyne. It bounced out to Gundogan who powered home for his fifth league goal of the season. City dominated after half time but sensationally found themselves behind once again thanks to Kane, who was linked with a move to Manchester last summer. Son turned creator once again and whipped a lovely cross in for Kane who smashed home, first time, with authority. It stunned the home side and Kane managed to get the ball in the back of the net again, but was judged to be offside."
